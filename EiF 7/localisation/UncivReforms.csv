vacuum_distillation;Vacuum Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
vacuum_distillation_desc;Vacuum distillation is a process for separating hydrocarbons using pressure. The liquid hydrocarbons are channeled into the lower portion of the distillation column at a temperature no greater than 370 degrees Celsius at an absolute pressure. The pressure in the column increases gradually from the top of the column to the bottom. The hydrocarbons evaporate and are piped out at various levels whenever the atmospheric pressure above the hydrocarbon to be distilled is lower than its vapor pressure. Vacuum distillation increases the relative volatility of the components, making the separation process quicker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
fractional_distillation;Fractional Distillation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
fractional_distillation_desc;Fractional Distillation is a process of separating crude oil into various fractions of hydrocarbons. The Crude Oil is heated to a temperature between 350 and 370 degrees Celsius which causes vaporization. The gas is then fed into a fractional distillation column, which is made up of several trays and outflowing channels. As the vapour rises, it cools according to its boiling point. The fractions with high boiling points condense into the lower trays; those with lower boiling points condense in the upper trays.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
fluid_catalytic_cracking;Fluid Catalytic Cracking;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
fluid_catalytic_cracking_desc;Fluid Catalytic Cracking is the most significant of the refining processes. It converts the high-boiling components of heavy crude oils into low-boiling, high-octane components such as gasoline and aviation fuels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
bergius_process;Bergius Process;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
bergius_process_desc;The Bergius Process is a chemical process developed by German chemist Friedrich Bergius in 1913. The Bergius Process diectly converts coal to useful synthetic fuels. Once finely ground, the coal is dried by the addition of hot gas. Heavy oil is recycled from the process and added to the mixture. A catalyst may also be introduced to trigger or speed up the conversion reaction. Bergius received the Nobel Prize in 1931 for his work in high pressure chemistry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
fischer_tropsch_process;Fischer-Tropsch Process;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
fischer_tropsch_process_desc;The Fischer Tropsh Process was developed at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung in 1925 by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. The Fischer-Tropsch Process indirectly produces synthetic oils and fuels via a series of reactions. Coal or Natural Gas is converted to a gaseous state, and then reacts with a mixture of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen to produce various hydrocarbon products. Nazi Germany used this process extensively in the Second World War to convert their abundant coal stocks into replacement fuels after they were cut off from most natural sources of oil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

montesquieu_desc;Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu was a French lawyer and political philosopher. He was best known for his support of constitutional government with a clear separation of powers. In his most famous work, 'The Spirit of the Laws (1748),' Montesquieu developed a series of classification sytems to describe governments and societies. He divided French society into three classes: the monarchy, the aristocracy and the commons, and he said that they should be equally dependent on and separate from eachother. Government administration was divided into three branches, the executive, legislative, and the judicial. His separation of powers later became embedded in the U.S. and other modern constitutions. He popularized the term 'Despotism' by describing it as one of the three basic forms of government, along with Monarchy and Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
rousseau;Jean-Jacques Rousseau;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
rousseau_desc;Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French writer and philosopher. Rousseau's many publications provided a central inspiration for the French Revolution. In 'Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men (1754),' Rousseau refuted Hobbes' conception of the Social Contract as being imposed on the masses by the powerful in society, thereby instituting inequality into the civil society. In 'The Social Contract (1762) Rousseau argued against the divine right of monarchs and asserted that sovereignty resides with the people. However, he argued that government must be separate from the legislative power of the sovereignty for the application of laws and that it was the duty of the people to abolish an overreaching government. Under his version of the Social Contract, the people had a right of freedom to withdraw from it except in time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

The Encyclopedia was the most comprehensive collection of Enlightenment thought and knowledge in every field from philosophy and the arts to science and technology. Its contributors included Diderot himself and most of his leading cotemporaries including Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau. Diderot's support for religious and political freedoms and the importance of modern science and industry was opposed by the aristoratic society in France. His encyclopedia was officially suppressed in 1759 and he had to complete much of the work on his own thereafter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
immanuel_kant;Immanuel Kant;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
immanuel_kant_desc;Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher, highly influential in many fields such as metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics,and political philosophy. He promoted as a central theme of the Enlightenment the application of reason to sujective experiences in order to derive knowledge. Kant published 'The Critique of Pure Reason (1781)' in which he argued for a 'Copernican revolution' in philosophy. Kant's doctrine became known as Transcendental Idealism. Kant believed that humans do not experience the world in a direct way, but in a phenomenal way using our senses. These experiences are thus purely subjective and incapable of comprehension as they are (in and of themselves) until processed through Reason. He stated that concepts of mathematics, space and time were transcendental. That is, they were necessary preconditions for the possibilities of experience. His theories influenced a wide spectrum of thinkers and scientists within many disciplines.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
david_hume;David Hume;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
david_hume_desc;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian and essayist, highly influential in the fields of empiricism and skepticism. Hume argued in 'A Treatise of Human Nature (1739)' that the psychological basis for human behaviour was desire rather than reason. He rejected the views of Locke that humans were born with innate ideas, believing instead that knowledge is derived solely from direct experience. Hume wrote that moral actions came from passions and were intrisically motivated, rather than derived from Reason. He believed in the compatibility of scientific determinism with the concept of free will. The exercise of liberty in fact requires the uniform physical laws governing the natural world, or else our exercise of free will would be nothing more than an act of chance. Hume influenced a diverse group of contemporary and subsequent writers including William James, Adam Smith and Kant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

mary_wollstonecraft_desc;Mary Wollstonecraft was an English philosopher and writer who was an early proponent of women's rights. She criticzed Rousseau's subordination of women to a solely domestic role. In 'Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792)' she argued that women only appeared to be inferior to men due to a lack of education. Wollstonecraft believed in treating men and women equally before God as rational, thinking beings, although she conceded a vague predominance of men in a physical sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

cesare_beccaria_desc;Cesare Marquis Beccaria-Bonesana was an Italian jurist and philosopher. He was best known for his 1764 treatise 'On Crime and Punishments.' Beccaria argued against torture and for the abolition of the death penalty. He believed that the state did not possess the right to take lives and because capital punishment was neither a useful nor a necessary deterrent to crime. A number of his principles such as the proportionality and promptness of punishment continue to form the basis of criminal justice in modern societies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

thomas_jefferson_desc;Thomas Jefferson was one of the 'Founding Fathers' of the United States of America. Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776," in which he asserted that all men had ""certain inalienable rights."" He believed in the paramount importance of individual liberties", and argued that liberty should only be limited insofar as it infringed upon the equal rights and liberties of others. Jefferson served as the Third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 and worked to limit the power of the federal government, favouring decentralisation and protecting the rights of individuals. Jefferson promoted science and education and believed in a wall of separating between church and state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

Intelligence theorists would propose methods by which individuals and society could improve itself; they also inspired darker movements such as the Nazis to try to eliminate those considered unfit. Today's IQ test is the direct legacy of intelligence measurement in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,
francis_galton;Francis Galton;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
"francis_galton_desc;Sir Francis Galton was a British aristocrat who wrote extensively on the measurement of an individual's mental abilities using sensory and motor tests. His 1869 work ""Hereditary Genius:  An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences"" argued that the children of geniuses tended to become geniuses themselves. He surveyed thousands of fellow academics", publishing in 1874 his findings that intelligence was primarily a heritable trait, although there was some necessity for environmental nurturance of that trait. He was the first to use identical and fraternal twins to measure the effects of nature versus nurture, and established in 1888 the theoretical basis for correlation, scatterplots, and regression as measurement tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,
alfred_binet;Alfred Binet;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
alfred_binet_desc;Alfred Binet was a French psychologist who pioneered the use of standardized testing to measure individual differences in intelligence. The French government commissioned Binet and his student Theodore Simon to develop a test in 1899 to differentiate 'retarded' from 'normal' children. The Simon-Binet test divided intelligence into several areas and measured each with a battery of questions. Questions considered to measure higher ability were those answered more often by students whom their teachers had rated highly. Binet also believed that intelligences were inherited, but improvable by education. His test assigned a single 'mental-level' score to each subject based on their test results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,
charles_spearman;Charles Spearman;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
charles_spearman_desc;Charles Spearman was a British psychologist and mathematician. Spearman criticized Galton's tests as being too simple to measure intelligence. He preferred Binet's test, but criticized the use of a universal number to characterize different areas of intelligence. He developed the process of factor analysis, measuring correlations between performance in different test areas. He proposed two underlying factors 'g' for general intelligence to explain the correlations and 's' for specific abilities to explain the imperfections in his correlations. His 'g'factor was not a concrete number, but he too believed in the heritability of intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,
eugenics;Eugenics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
eugenics_desc;An outgrowth from Darwinistic ideas on natural selection and trait theories and from the studies in intelligence measurement, Eugenics was concerned with the mental and physical traits found in society and a response to the weaknesses found. Positive eugenics encouraged family programs, social welfare, and the importance of education in the desirability of breeding to increase the appearance of positive traits. Negative eugenics argued for the need to remove weak traits by removing undesirable elements, leading to sterilization and even extermination of target groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
wilhelm_wundt;Wilhelm Wundt;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
wilhelm_wundt_desc;Wilhelm Wundt was a German physiologist who opened the first university-based psychological laborator in Leipzig in 1879. Wundt published the first textbook to identify psychology as a science; his 'two reaction-time' tasks demonstrated that complex sequences are the combination of more elementary processes. This was the foundation of Cognitive Psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
edward_titchener;Edward Titchener;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
edward_titchener_desc;Edward Titchener was an English psychologist who studied under Wundt at Leipzig. Titchener headed the psychology department at Cornell University and founded the Structuralist school, which relied heavily on introspection to perform analysis on the structure of the mind. His attempts to break down experiences into four basic elements was discredited because it was possible for different subjects to identify different elements from the same experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,
william_james;William James;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
william_james_desc;William James was an American psychologist and philosopher at Harvard University. James emphasized the the study of the purposes and functions of the mind, rather than its structure. James is considered the founder of the Functionalist school. He used experiments and introspection, but disclaimed introspection as scientific proof.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,
gs_hall;G. Stanley Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
gs_hall_desc;G. Stanley Hall was the first President of the American Psychological Association. Hall founded the American Journal of Psychology in 1887. His research focused on educational psychology and adolescence; he adapted the term 'Storm and Stress' to characterize the period of adolescence. Hall believed in the heritability of behavior and supported the Eugenics program. His views on child development were later largely refuted by Piaget and Vygotsky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
hermann_ebbinghaus;Hermann Ebbinghaus;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
hermann_ebbinghaus_desc;Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist who pioneered studies in memory. Ebbinghaus used himself as subject in thousands of repetitions of his 'nonsense syllables.' Among his contributions to the field were the learning curve, the forgetting curve, and the serial position effect, which demonstrated that individuals remember the most recent information first presented. He documented 'savings': information relearned a second time is memorized faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,
mary_calkins;Mary Calkins;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
mary_calkins_desc;Mary Calkins was an American teacher who became the first female President of the American Psychological Association. A student of James' in 1890, Calkins completed the requirements for a PhD at Harvard only to be refused. She went on to a distinguished tenure at Wellesley College, writing about the psychology of the self: 'a totality, a one of many characters... a unique being in the sense that I am I and you are you'....;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,
sigmund_freud;Sigmund Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
sigmund_freud_desc;Sigmund Freud was an Austrian psychologist who founded the discipline of Psychoanalysis. Freud focused on the unconscious mind, dividing it into the id, ego, and superego. Freud believed that unconscious motivations guided the behaviour of his patients and these need to be identified by looking for thoughts and actions that did not fit normal explanation. Manifestation of sexual and aggressive drives were most likely explanations for the differences observed in personality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,
carl_jung;Carl Jung;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
carl_jung_desc;Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and contemporary of Freud. Jung proposed a second, deeper level of collective unconscious, where a number of universal personality types known as archetypes were formed from patterns of emotions and experiences. Jung pioneered dream analysis, arguing that archetypes, complexes and motives manifested themselves through dreams. He was influential in developing the concepts of synchronicity, introversion and extraversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,
alfred_adler;Alfred Adler;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
alfred_adler_desc;Alfred Adler was an Austrian doctor and psychtherapist. Adler diverged from Freud in arguing that unconscious motivation could be better explained by teleological goals rather than instinctual drives. According to Adler, people are born with a feeling of Inferiority. People attempt to overcome these feelings of inferiority. Adler posited one of three outcomes. An 'inferiority complex' develops in people who are overwhelmed by these feelings. Some of these will develop a superiority complex to mask their true feelings. Psychologically healthy people manifest the concept of self-esteem and satsify their goals through a sense of personal achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,
anna_freud;Anna Freud;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
anna_freud_desc;The daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna began her psychoanalytic practice in 1923. She served as secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association between 1925 and 1934. Freud became known for her work on the social importance of the ego in childhood development. She wrote 'Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense' (1936) in which she further developed the concept of defense mechanisms such as repression, displacement, reaction formation and rationalization. These are mental processes to reduce consciousness of wishes, memories and thoughts that prove threatening to self-esteem and security of the individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,
karen_horney;Karen Horney;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
karen_horney_desc;Karen Horney was a German psychoanalyst. She came to criticize Freud's emphasis on sex and aggressive as motivating drives. Horney (1937) focused on security instead as the central, inborn human need. In her view, child development was contingent upon parental fulfillment of the child's 'basic anxiety' emotion. Success would result in a trusting individual, while failure would result in insecurity. Insecurity and distrust manifests itself in personality as either avoidance, submission or dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,
ivan_pavlov;Ivan Pavlov;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
ivan_pavlov_desc;Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist and winner of the Nobel Prize for his work on reflexes in digestion. In the course of studies with dogs and salivation, Pavlov observed that the dogs elicited a certain type of salivation with certain signals that preceeded the arrival of food. In his 1927 study, Pavlov laid out the basic principles of classical conditioning in Behaviorism. The food was the unconditioned stimulus for salivation. The signal became associated with salivation as a conditioned stimulus, with salivation to the sound of the signal alone becoming the new conditioned response. Extinction, recovery, generalization and discrimination were identified in subsequent studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,
el_thorndike;Edward L. Thorndike;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
el_thorndike_desc;Edward Lee Thorndike was an American researcher who also conducted experiments in animal learning. He was known for his puzzle-box procedure (1898), in which a hungry cat was placed inside a small cage and observed to see how long it took the cat to learn to pull the lever and escape, where food was waiting. He observed that after 20-30 trials, the cats had become efficient at escaping almost instantaneously. Thorndike formulated the law of effect, stating that responses producing a positive effect became more likely to occur again, and those producing discomfort were less likely to occur again. These observations were later transformed by B.F. Skinner into the concept of operant conditioning in psychology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,
jb_watson;John B. Watson;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
jb_watson_desc;John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who studied Pavlovian conditioning in humans. Watson's most famous experiment involved conditioning an 11-year old child named Albert to associate a conditioned stimulus (fear of rats) to an unconditioned stimulus (fear of a loud hammering sound). Watson's research later led to clinical treatments extinguishing irrational fears in people. After being dismissed from Harvard over an affair and marriage with a graduate student, Watson brought his research experience to a prominent advertising firm; modern advertising owed much to behaviorist psychology and conditioning concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,
ec_tolman;Edward C. Tolman;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,
ec_tolman_desc;Edward C. Tolman was another prominent American psychologist in the field of Behaviorism. Tolman performed maze experiments to demonstrate latent learning in animals. He showed that a rat could run the maze on the first try, if it was previously allowed to explore the maze while not hungry. Tolman evinced that the subject learned useful stimulus information about the world without reference to a reinforcing stimulus (the food). The ability to run the maze correctly on trial one demonstrated flexibility in the use of the learned information. Tolman's stimulus-stimulus (S-S) learning was opposed by the stimulus-response (S-R) orthodoxy of Skinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,

auguste_comte;Auguste Comte;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
auguste_comte_desc;Isidore Auguste Marie François Xavier Comte was a french philosopher who founded the political and philosophical movement known as Positivism. He is best known for his six-volume work 'TheCourse on Positive Philosophy (1830-1842)' in which he described a law of three stages in the development of the human mind and developed a unifying philosophy of science. Comte's law was a progressive process. The human mind begins by seeking answers to its questions in theology. Mental development passes through a transition stage to a 'positive' or final state, where supernatural or abstract causes are rejected in favour of seeking answers through scientific laws. His accompanying philosophy of science was influential for decades after his death. Within the positivist framework, the interrelation of the various branches of sciences is maintained despite their increasing divergence and level of specialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

th_huxley_desc;Thomas Henry Huxley was an English biologist, nautral scientist and social thinker. Huxley became a passionate adherent and defender of Charles Darwin and the concept of Evolution after reading Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' He famously defeated Archbishop Samuel Wilberforce in an 1860 debate on the Theory of Evolution. Huxley promoted the development of scientific education over religious traditions, coining the term 'agnostic' for his beliefs. He founded the X-Club in 1869 with a group of likeminded scientists and researchers. The X-Club would go on to found the scientific journal Nature in 1869, which still publishes today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

motor_housing_insulation;Motor Housing Insulation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
motor_housing_insulation_desc;Early electric motors were prone to sparking. This made the use of electric tools and machinery unsafe for underground mining due to the greatly increased possiblity of starting underground fires and explosions. American mining engineer Henry Beecher Dierdorff invented insulation that could be tightly wrapped around the housing of the electric motor to prevent sparks. This allowed for the safe use of electric cutting tools in the mines for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

conveyor_belt_desc;The conveyor belt consisted of two pulleys with a continuous loop of material, powered by a motor transmission. The engineering firm Sandvik of Sweden was producing steel conveyor belts by 1891. Thomas Robins developed a conveyor belt that replaced expensive steel with rubber. In 1905, Thomas Sutcliffe patented the first conveyor belt for use underground. The conveyor belt made it easy to transport ores out of the mines, and was soon adopted by Henry Ford in his new assembly line factories.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
pneumatic_drill;Pneumatic Drill;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
pneumatic_drill_desc;The pneumatic drill is a mechanical drill driven by compressed air. Reciprocating pistons drive the compressed air upwards and down, propelling the drill bit into a surface and then drawing it out again. Pneumatic tools became preferred in the construction and operation of mining shafts and tunnels. Earlier tools had required steam power, and steam power required fire which was too dangerous due to the risk of igniting flammable gases underground. Larger pneumatic drilling machines utilized an external air compressor which could also help to ventilate the underground mines.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

steam_shovel_desc;The steam shovel was the first powered excavating machine. Willia Otis patented an original design in 1839. Early steam shovels were 'partial-swing,' meaning the boom and winch could not rotate a full 360 degrees. Steam shovels became more widespread in the last half of the nineteenth century with the development of steel cables and a full-swing design. Steam shovels operated on railways until the invention of caterpillar tracks, and were heavily involved in the development of large-scale,open-pit mining. 102 steam shovels were employed to excavate the Panama Canal.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

minie_ball_desc;The Minié ball is a conical-shaped bullet made of iron and soft lead. It was developed in 1849 by French army captain Claude-Etienne Minié based on the work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne. The Minié bullet solved the problem of designing ammunition for the new muzzle-loaded rifles. The bullet expanded to fit the tight rifling grooves when fired, allowing for a greater muzzle velocity and range of accuracy. The greater speed and weight of the Minié ball meant wounds were more severe and required more amputations as the bullets would tear straight through and shatter muscles, tendons, and bones;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
barbed_wire;Barbed Wire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
barbed_wire_desc;Barbed Wire was a late-nineteenth century American invention, used originally to keep herds of cattle fenced in. Barbed Wire became integrated with the trench systems of World War One as it was relatively easy to string up and often survived artillery bombardments and machine gun fire. The sharp barbs caused injury to attacking infantry. Emplacing rows of barbed wire in front of the trench line gave the machine gunners and field batteries time to decimate an attack while it was stuck cutting the wire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

quick_firing_field_guns_desc;Quick-Firing Field Guns are breech-loaded artillery pieces that combine several characteristics to produce a high rate of fire. Buffer mechanisms and self-contained ammunition limited and then eliminated recoil of the barrel. Innovations in breech technology allowed for rapid reloading of the gun. One of an interrupted-screw or sliding-block system sealed the breech to conserve firing velocity. One of the most successful quick-firing designs was the French 'Canon de 75 modèle 1897.' This 75mm piece could fire fifteen rounds per minute of high-explosive and shrapnel, devastating attacking infantry. Other nations quickly copied the technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
indirect_fire_techniques;Indirect Fire Techniques;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
indirect_fire_techniques_desc;Indirect fire involves aiming and firing artillery projectiles on targets not in a direct line of sight. The degree of accuracy achieved is dependent on calculations of the azimuth (an angular measurement of the target point relative to the reference point) and firing elevation of the gun.  The first practical manual was written in 1882 by a Russian officer, KG Guk. Guk described how to fix aiming points for firing arcs using geometry. The lack of a device to measure azimuth was solved in 1890 when Germany introduced the lining-plane. The lining-plane was mounted in-line with the bore and enabled the measurement of large angles. The effectiveness of indirect fire increased greatly with actual battlefield experience in the First World War. The introduction of airborne spotters in balloons and aircraft allowed for gun crews to correct their firing calculations during battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
